# This is a sample user dictionary for Kuromoji (JapaneseTokenizer)
#
# Add entries to this file in order to override the statistical model in terms
# of segmentation, readings and part-of-speech tags.  Notice that entries do
# not have weights since they are always used when found.  This is by-design
# in order to maximize ease-of-use.
#
# Entries are defined using the following CSV format:
#  <text>,<token 1> ... <token n>,<reading 1> ... <reading n>,<part-of-speech tag>
#
# Notice that a single half-width space separates tokens and readings, and
# that the number tokens and readings must match exactly.
#
# Also notice that multiple entries with the same <text> is undefined.
#
# Whitespace only lines are ignored.  Comments are not allowed on entry lines.
